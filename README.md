# Etch-a-sketch
This project is part of The Odin Project – Foundations Course.
The goal is to build a simple Etch-a-Sketch style webpage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Generates a 16×16 grid of square divs using JavaScript (no hard-coding!)

Uses Flexbox to layout the squares in a responsive grid

Hover effect: moving the mouse over a square changes its color

Click-and-drag coloring for smooth drawing

Button that:

Prompts the user for the number of squares per side

Clears the old grid

Generates a new grid up to 100×100

Fits the grid into the same total space (e.g., 480px/960px)

Random colors with increasing opacity on repeated passes

Fully dynamic and interactive sketch pad
